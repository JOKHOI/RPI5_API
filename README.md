# RPI5_API


This capstone project involves designing a biometric signal acquisition platform using the STM32WB5MM-DK-BSP. 
The acquired data is transmitted via BLE-SERIAL to a Raspberry Pi 5(RPI5), where it is displayed and stored in real-time.

This is the RPI5's software which was coded in python and then after revision coded in C for it's communication between the acquisition platform and the data storage.
The data display is left in python.
